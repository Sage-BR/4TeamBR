Meow! Greetings! I'm Roy the Cat!<br>
My master, the great collector Bashtal from the Bronze Key guild, has asked me and my friends to collect medals that were scattered throughout the world. The search has brought me to this village!<br>
I'm organizing an event I'm calling the<font color="LEVEL"> Medal Collecting Event</font>! Anyone who brings medals will receive fabulous prizes! Meow!<br>
