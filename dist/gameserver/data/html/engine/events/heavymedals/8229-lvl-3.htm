Wow! Are you really a <font color="LEVEL">Fox</font> level collector? ~Meow! I wouldn't have known at first glance, but now that I get a closer look at you, I can see it in your eyes! I'm sure your'e already familiar with the game, so I'll keep the explanation brief...<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you wish to become a Wolf level collector, pay me 40 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you! ~Meow!</font> You can play as many times as you want, as long as you have enough glittering medals.<br>
